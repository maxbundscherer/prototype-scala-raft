## Let's get started

- Tested on ``macOs 10.15.2`` with ``openjdk64-11.0.2`` and ``sbt 1.3.3``

- You need [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) to build and run project
- You need [openjdk64-11.0.2](https://jdk.java.net/archive/)

- Run with: ``sbt run``
- Test with: ``sbt test`` (or see GitHub-Actions-CI-Pipeline)

## Talk about ...

- ... enums in scala
- ... typed akka actors (and service layer alternative)
- ... fsm in akka actor
- ... difference between ``scheduleWithFixedDelay`` and ``scheduleAtFixedRate`` in akka
